# handy-scripts
This is a collection of handy scripts that i use to work everyday

# Note :

to extend functionalities like adding new aliases and bash functions or new tmux configurations.
you should create a file in the directory `dot-files/customs` with this naming  convention i.e assuming you want to add more aliases 
`touch dot-files/customs/.custom-bash_aliases` and place your aliases there, it will be loaded.... this should be done for nay new configurations..
we can now check later for good configs that will be added as default.
